# Project Euler (in different languages)

I like to pick up new languages/refresh my knowledge in languages I already know by doing [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems in them. This is just a repo with links to solutions in the languages I've done.

## Included Languages

* [Swift](https://github.com/gruiz17/SwiftEuler)
* [Clojure](https://github.com/gruiz17/clojure-euler) (warning: a year old, some solutions not optimal)
* [Ruby] (https://github.com/gruiz17/rb-euler)
